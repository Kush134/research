## About

<p> People publish a lot of fascinating research out to the world, yet the tools to consume this research are quite primitive. It is also really hard to understand the research papers. </p>
  
<p>PaperBrain is the go-to platform for accessing and understanding research papers. We provide a fascinating interface for users to search for papers and return a list of papers with their abstracts and a direct pdf link in a prettified format.

Since research papers are generally difficult to understand, we have added a explain paper feature using Open AI's GPT-3 model. Users can simply copy-paste an excerpt and our primed model will translate it into an easy and understandable form.
